We will not offer support for:

1. Customisations of this plugin or any plugins it relies upon
2. Conflicts with "premium" themes from ThemeForest and similar marketplaces (due to bad practice and not being readily available to test)

If you need help with customisation you will need to find and hire a developer capable of making the changes.
